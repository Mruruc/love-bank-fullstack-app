# React 

## Why do we need to 'import React from ' "react" in our file ?
because the JSX is defined in it.
or React is what defines JSX.

## If I were to console.log(page) in index.js what would happen ? 

```React 
const page =(
    <div>
    <h1>Hello Baby!</h1>
    </div>
);
```

since the page is JSX, it will return the javaScript object.

## is React component returns the multiple element ?

No, it is not. if we want to return multiple the element we should surround with in a parent element.
